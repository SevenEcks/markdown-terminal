# Markdown-Terminal

This project is an extension of [Markdown](https://github.com/cebe/markdown) that adds the ability to convert markdown to terminal output instead of HTML.

You can use the setConfig function to set various config options for colorizing the output.

composer require sevenecks/markdown-terminal
```

protected function renderStrong($block)
{
    return \$this->colorize->bold(\$this->renderAbsy($block[1]));
